# UPlan4
UPlan is a simple rule based urban growth model intended for regional or county level modeling. The needed space for each land use type is calculated from simple demographics and assigned based on the net attractiveness of locations to that land use (based on user input), locations unsuitable for any development and a general plan that determines where specific types of development are permitted.

This is a Python Toolbox and needs to be ran in Esri's ArcToolbox.

The User Manual is contained in the Documents folder. Read this document for general information about the model, how to get started, and step-by-step instructions for each of the tools it contains.
